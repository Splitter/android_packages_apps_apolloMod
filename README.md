android_packages_apps_apolloMod:-
===============================
### This project is no longer under development. Most changes/features I wanted(and more) now exist in many other players these days. Many incorporated into the original Apollo Player itself. That said, if any of those who forked this project are still actively developing their versions let me know. And I will happily add a link to your github here. 

ApolloMod is an open source music player based on CyanogenMod's Apollo Music Player and released under the same Apache License. It has many changes to the layout and basic functionality as well as a growing list of new features. 

New Features:
- Reworked ALOT of the UI, some big changes & some small(check the screenshots below)
- Now playing screen is now a panel that slides up from the bottom actionbar
- Drag/Drop sortable playlist and now playing queue(with swipe to remove)
- Swipe left/right to change song on now playing view
- Built in simple Eq when no external Eq is available
- Prev button actually works when in shuffle mode
- 'Shuffle All' action now creates an actual shuffled playlist of all songs(previously would create an ordered playlist with shuffle mode enabled)
- Fetches album art from files before fetching from the web
- Ability to edit album, artist, playlist & genre images(long press images on their respective views)
- Tab visibility controls(only show the tabs you wish)
- Grabs highest quality images available from the web
- Ability to choose widget style (holo dark or holo light)
- Extended notifications
- Audio visualizations on now playing screen(experimental at this point)
